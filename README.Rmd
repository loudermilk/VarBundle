# VarBundle
```{r, out.width = "120px", echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics("inst/images/varbundle.png")
```

VarBundle supports defensive programming by making it easy for R developers to bundle conceptually related read-only variables in a named, list-like object of immutable constants. 

## Installation  

```{r installation, eval = FALSE}
# Install the released version from CRAN:
# Not yet available
# install.packages("VarBundle")

# Install the development version from GitHub:
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("loudermilk/VarBundle")
```

## Usage  

##### VarBundle fields can be accessed like lists.
```{r}
library(VarBundle)
thresholds <- varbundle(list(min = 1, max = 100))

# Read-only Access
thresholds$max #100
thresholds[["min"]] #1
```
##### But fields are read-only and new fields cannot be added after object creation.
```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
# Assignment throws error
thresholds$min <- 25 # VarBundle fields are read only.

# Cannot create new fields after object creation
thesholds$foo <- 10 # Cannot add new fields to VarBundle
```

##### The quickest way to learn about {VarBundle} is to read the vignette.

```{r}
browseVignettes(package = "VarBundle")
```
